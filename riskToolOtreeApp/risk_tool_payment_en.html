We would now like to illustrate the risks associated with different investment options using an interactive program, before you make your investment decision.</p>
<hr>
<p>
    Imagine that you would like to invest ${{ C.budget_string }} over a period of {{ C.Anlagehorizont }} years. You can choose between two types of investments:
    
    <ul>
    <li> <b>A traditional savings account</b> – a safe option with low but fixed interest rates.</li>
    <li> <b>An investment in an ETF (exchange-traded fund) on the stock market </b> –  this allows you to benefit from potential price increases and dividends, but also involves the risk that the value of your investment may fluctuate or decrease.</li>
    </ul>
    You can decide <b>how to split your money between these two options</b> – from putting everything into one option to any combination in between.
     To give you a better idea of how different allocations could affect your final wealth, we have developed a <b>simulated investment tool</b>.
     It shows you what results similar investments have achieved in the past.

    </p>
<!-- Ihnen helfen Ihre persönliche Risikoeinstellung, also das Risiko-Ertrags-Profil, mit dem Sie sich wohlfühlen zu ermitteln.-->
<hr>

<b> Important: </b>
<p>
Every 50th participant in this study will receive a payout equal to the actual final value of the simulated portfolio, paid in cents.
</p>
<p>
    Example: If your simulated final wealth is {{ C.budget_string }} euros, you will receive a payout of {{ Auszahlung }} euros.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The simulation is based on real historical market data.</li>
    <li>The payout will be made within one month after your participation.</li>
</ul>

Please click "Next" to continue and specify your preferred allocation between the two investment options.
